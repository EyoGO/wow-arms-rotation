# Rotation timeline for (4T5+2T6) ARMS warrior (WoW Sirus)
Convenient web page to track and evaluate rotations for arms warrior, since the whole gameplay is 
based on applying Rend and tracking seconds of its ticks, what is pretty complicated to keep in mind, 
there is all necessary data like current time, current second of Rend and same information 
for each previously pressed ability.

### Possible improvements
- Add ability to write rules to get rid of using abilities manually, so program can simulate rotations 
using these rules for huge amount of time to have large data sample.

### Known issues
- Last Taste for Blood tick from 0's second of Rend is not removed after 9 seconds as it works in game. 
It is acceptable because arms becomes unplayable without updated Rend and there are no abilities to fit in 9
seconds besides updating Rend and continuing using Overpowers.
